### Hi there 👋 My name is Tony Fadayomi

I've been researching cyber security for 5+ years with a specialization in Cloud, Automation, Pentesting, AWS, Infrastructure. I'm now honing my skillset in cloud threat detections & cloud development as well as studying my curiosities in my spare time such as CTFs.
